The link to my game (should work on all computers):

Credits to Unity for the tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=6
I added jump and double jump feature
To play: 
1) Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the ball, use the space bar to jump/double jump
2) Try to collect all the green objects
3) Don't let the enemy (red) catch up to you!
